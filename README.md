# CSharp-Calculator

## Remaining work:
* Negative numbers (all operators should handle negatives of both operators!)
* Need to add a function to ensure that negatives are real negatives! if the character before a negative first operand is a digit, the first operand is not negative
* Unary maths functions (more than just the absolute fn)
* UI
* API (Function App)
* Cleaning equation strings
